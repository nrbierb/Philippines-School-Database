Definitions</H1>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Period: This indicates the time of the
class. For example, for many schools the time from 7:30 to 8:30 would
be “First Period”, the time from 8:30 to 9:30 would be “Second
Period”, etc. This can be defined for each school depending upon
the school's schedule.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Section: This is a group of students
who share most or all of the same classes and have an assigned
teacher as a section adviser.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Class: A class is defined as a group of
students who meet at a certain class period and classroom for a
specific subject for a given school year. An example is a section of
Science III that meets during the third period. The name of this
class in the database would be “Science-III - Third Period -
Teacher's Name”. Some classes do not meet as a section, and they
will have unique name. For example, the TLE I students majoring in
ICT meeting during the fifth period would have a class name of
“TLE-I-ICT - Fifth Period - Teacher's Name”, while the other
group of TLE I students majoring in garments meeting during the six
period may have a class name of “TLE-I-ICT - Sixth Period -
Teacher's Name”. Most teachers have several classes that they are
responsible for.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Student: A student will be entered only
once in the database, and their historical information will be saved
for their entire career in the school system.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grades: This refers to grades received
by individual students in each subject area at the end of each
grading period.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enrollment Status: This indicates
whether a student is Enrolled, Graduated, Dropped Out, or
Transferred.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[NOT ACTIVE] Gradebook Item: A
gradebook item is defined for a class each time the teacher has the
students in that class perform a task. A gradebook item can be a
quiz, a test, a participation score, a project, etc. -- anything for
which the teacher will assign a grade for a given class. For example,
if the teacher of Science III Fifth Period has a quiz, they will add
a gradebook item for that quiz for the students of Science III Fifth
Period. The gradebook items can be different for each class that the
teacher teaches.

many places, when you make a change you will be asked to enter the
date of change. For example, when you change a student's enrollment
status, section, or major, you will be asked for Date of Change. It
is extremely important that you enter that date every time and that
the date is accurate. This is because this date is used in managing a
student's history in the school and for setting attendance and many
other records.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=3>All of the boxes for entering information will be
colored either white or tan. Boxes that are white allow you to type
in anything you want. Boxes that are tan (such as Barangay or a
teacher's name) will only allow entries that have already been
determined by the Guidance Office. You can start typing letters in
the box, and it will show the options that match those letters. For
example, if you type an “f” in “Class Year”, it will show you
the options of “First Year” and “Fourth Year”. If you type
“fi”, you will see the option of “First Year”. If you want to
see what all of the options are, double-click with your left mouse
button in the tan box and it will show the list of options that you
can choose. IF YOU TYPE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INTO A TAN
BOX, IT WILL <U>NOT</U> SAVE THAT VALUE. If you see an option that is
missing in a tan box and needs to be added, please contact the
Guidance Office and they can add it using the “Maintenance”

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>In
many cases, there are multiple ways to find and select things. An
example is shown on the next page for selecting a student. You can
ask for students that have a certain enrollment status, a certain
class year, or a certain section. You can also just start typing
their family name.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>You
do not have to fill out all of these, only the ones that are
important to you. The others you can leave blank. However if you fill
out more than one box, it is best if you do them in the order shown
(for example, you would fill out “Section” before you entered
“Family Name”). The last thing you should do is always at the
bottom of the list (in the example above, this is “Family Name”).
You can just start typing the first few letters of the student's
family name, and it will try to guess the name. If you need to show
all names, you can double-click with your left mouse button in
“Family Name” (this is very slow, so it is much better if you can
type a few letters of the family name). After you have entered
something in “Family Name”, a list of students is shown. You can
select the student you want by left-clicking on it once and then
either hitting the Enter key or left-clicking once on “Select” at
the bottom of the list. Using “View a Student” as an example,
here are some examples of how this works:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>A.
To show all Third Year students, select “Third Year” in “Class
Year” and then double-click with your left mouse button in “Family
Name”.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>B.
To show all students in section Rizal, select “Rizal” in
“Section” and then double-click with your left mouse button in
“Family Name”.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>C.
To show all students with a family name that starts with “ba”,
type “ba” in “Family Name”.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>One
other nice feature is that if you select something in “Class
Level”, now the selections below (Section and Family Name) will
only include Sections and Students from that Class Level that you
selected. For example, if you select a Class Level of Third Year, it
will only show Third Year Sections in the Section box and Third Year
students in the Family Name box.</FONT></P>

show it in the order that it appears in “Selected Fields”, so it
is easiest if you add fields in the order that you want them shown on
your report. If you decide to change the order, you can remove the
fields from the “Selected Fields” list as described above and
then re-add them in the order you want. However you can also
rearrange them after you have copied and pasted them to a
spreadsheet.
